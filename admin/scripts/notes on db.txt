Dr Lewis notes:

- Create a new mysql database named 'uwalc2' with password 'UW@cs452'.
- Run the file 'createdb.sql' found in the â€‹'scripts' folder to create the tables in the db
- Run the attached SQL file to insert data into the tables.
NOTE: do not check in the attached file to github as it contains live production data.

My notes:

1) create a new db in phpmyadmin
2) import the file createdb.sql - make sure to have "Enable foreign key check" unchecked
3) Import file uwtestdb.sql (Had to remove two "unexpected characters" from the file before it would insert. Also, commentd out INSERT INTO `opportunity` section because it throws the error: Duplicate entry '1' for key primary, which causes the rest of the data to not get inserted)
4)click on the uwalc2 database to put it in focus. Then click on the priviges tab. click 'add user account'. 
input the following data:
user name: uwalc2
host name: localhost
password: UW@cs452
check the global privilges box, and make sure grant all privilges is checked. 
click Go
